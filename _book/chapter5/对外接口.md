# 第二节 对外接口


**1.Open()创建数据库接口**

```go
// Open creates and opens a database at the given path.
// If the file does not exist then it will be created automatically.
// Passing in nil options will cause Bolt to open the database with the default options.
// 创建数据库接口
func Open(path string, mode os.FileMode, options *Options) (*DB, error)

```

**2.View()查询接口**

```go
// View executes a function within the context of a managed read-only transaction.
// Any error that is returned from the function is returned from the View() method.
//
// Attempting to manually rollback within the function will cause a panic.
func (db *DB) View(fn func(*Tx) error) error
```

**3.Update()更新接口**

```go
// Update executes a function within the context of a read-write managed transaction.
// If no error is returned from the function then the transaction is committed.
// If an error is returned then the entire transaction is rolled back.
// Any error that is returned from the function or returned from the commit is
// returned from the Update() method.
//
// Attempting to manually commit or rollback within the function will cause a panic.
func (db *DB) Update(fn func(*Tx) error) error
```

**4.Batch()批量更新接口**

```go
// Batch calls fn as part of a batch. It behaves similar to Update,
// except:
//
// 1. concurrent Batch calls can be combined into a single Bolt
// transaction.
//
// 2. the function passed to Batch may be called multiple times,
// regardless of whether it returns error or not.
//
// This means that Batch function side effects must be idempotent and
// take permanent effect only after a successful return is seen in
// caller.
//
// The maximum batch size and delay can be adjusted with DB.MaxBatchSize
// and DB.MaxBatchDelay, respectively.
//
// Batch is only useful when there are multiple goroutines calling it.
func (db *DB) Batch(fn func(*Tx) error) error

```

**5.Begin()开启事务接口**

```go
// Begin starts a new transaction.
// Multiple read-only transactions can be used concurrently but only one
// write transaction can be used at a time. Starting multiple write transactions
// will cause the calls to block and be serialized until the current write
// transaction finishes.
//
// Transactions should not be dependent on one another. Opening a read
// transaction and a write transaction in the same goroutine can cause the
// writer to deadlock because the database periodically needs to re-mmap itself
// as it grows and it cannot do that while a read transaction is open.
//
// If a long running read transaction (for example, a snapshot transaction) is
// needed, you might want to set DB.InitialMmapSize to a large enough value
// to avoid potential blocking of write transaction.
//
// IMPORTANT: You must close read-only transactions after you are finished or
// else the database will not reclaim old pages.
func (db *DB) Begin(writable bool) (*Tx, error)
```
